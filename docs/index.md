# Summer 2020 reflection
This summer has been a deeply enriching experience. IT was difficult to predict wher eour research would go, and how we adapt to the challenges of a remote format, but I believe we have  impressive results. 
# One thing I am thinking about doing 
This summer has taught me methods I believe will be very important as I develop my ideas for a thesis.
